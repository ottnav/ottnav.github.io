There is no special version dedicated to be used on Windows PC or Mac, however, there is a solution to use the app with negligible side effects.
Install NoxPlayer app on your PC - it allows running Android apps and is highly optimized and recommended.
Just use it like it was a native app.Some users are running the app on different emulators, like BlueStacks emulator and report that it also works quite well, and supports later Android versions.
Please note, that hardware acceleration might not be available when using emulator, so you might need selecting software codecs to watch your content.
