# OTT Navigator FAQ
## What is OTT Navigator?
OTT Navigator is a video player dedicated to work with streamed and vod content, usually provided by `OTT/IPTV` providers

## Which IPTV service should I use, or which is used by the app?
The app is just a player and neither has any content, nor can provide you any. In order to use it, you need having an IPTV provider and configuring it within the app.

## How can I contribute to the app development?
- Translate to your language or improve current translations
  - Translations are being available online at [github](http://github.com/ottnav/ott-nav-locale/) (source language supported by developer is English, you can take it as a base).
  - Then you choose either:
    - (Github way for tech-ready guys): fork the repository, make your changes and submit a pull request
    - (Easy way for normal people): just download the corresponding xml file (or create a new one taking strings.xml as a base contents), make changes that are required and send it to us via email
- Provide high-quality detailed description on the issues you are experiencing, and suggestions you feel will perfectly fit the app.
- Suggest common questions and solutions for the FAQ

# Installation

## How to install on non-Play Market device
- If you are running Huawei device, then use Huawei AppGallery to install the app
- If you are using Amazon device then use Aptoide market to install the app
- Alternatively you can sideload the app

## How to install on my Windows PC/Mac
There is no special version dedicated to be used on Windows PC or Mac, however, there is a solution to use the app with negligible side effects.
Install NoxPlayer app on your PC - it allows running Android apps and is highly optimized and recommended.
Just use it like it was a native app.Some users are running the app on different emulators, like BlueStacks emulator and report that it also works quite well, and supports later Android versions.  
Please note, that hardware acceleration might not be available when using emulator, so you might need selecting software codecs to watch your content.

## Will the app work on my TV? Why not WebOS/Tizen?
The app only works on Android, so if your TV is running Android TV / Google TV then it will run perfectly.
We have investigated the tech and even did some proof-of-concept, but WebOS/Tizen are simply not powerful enough to make a really good app. It's suitable for simple web pages that pretend to be apps, but lack real power to do complex under-the-hood tasks.
So if you choose an LG/Samsung TV (the only 2 major vendors that do not use Android these days) - then it's highly recommended to purchase an Android / AndroidTV / GoogleTV / Chromecast(2021+ model) / FireTV / etc box or stick to be attached, to make it really smart (not pretending to be one).

# Provider (playlist) configuration

## Which provider template should I choose?
- If your playlist contains something like `.../get.php?username=...&password=...&type=m3u_plus&output=...` most probably your choice is Xtream Codes template
- If the url contains something like `/stalker_portal/c/` then you should select either MAC or Stalker portal
- If you have a m3u file downloaded from provider, you should either upload it and setup as a Playlist (recommended), or configure as a Playlist File
- In other cases configuring as Playlist is generally preferable

## What playlist formats are supported
- Preffered format is [M3U/M3U8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U)
- However, the app also supports lots of more exotic formats (the support might be limited though), including `WebOS webtv`, `Tizen nStream`, `.xspf`, `.tv`, `sat .txt`, etc

## Playlist setup
Your options are one of the following (it’s always preferred to use links over files):
- Use a specialized service like [m3u4u](https://m3u4u.com/) or [m3u.in](https://app.m3u.in/) to upload your playlist and configure a link to it
- Use any cloud storage service you prefer. For example, if using Dropbox:
  - Copy a playlist file to your personal Dropbox cloud storage
  - In a context menu select `Dropbox -> Copy Link`
  - Open a text editor and paste a link there; replace `dl=0` to `dl=1` in the link (since by default it copies a link to the web page rather than to the file itself)
  - (Not recommended) copy file to Downloads directory, so the app will see it. However, file access is being limited in Android from version-to-version, and especially on Android TV devices, so better use any of the cloud storage.
  - (For admins) make a web server in the local network that is bind to host “iptv.local” and ensure that your playlist is available by HTTP request to `iptv.local/playlist.m3u` and the app will auto-detect the playlist
  - Also you can setup the player on your phone (not using files, links only!) and then use the backup/restore feature of the app to transfer configuration to your TV/box device!

## Getting IP blocked by provider (or 403 error)
These issues might be caused by different provider paranoid flood settings/connection restrictions that can affect access to service. Here are some recommendations if you experience such a problem:
- Check amount of connections your provider offers and configure provider parameters to match this value in order to limit picture-in-picture and other advanced modes
- Setting stream technology to MPEG-TS (`settings - extended`; HLS support on xtream codes servers is quite poor)
- Disabling video preview (`settings - lists - description`) and in general limit usage of picture-in-picture and studio mode
- Disable video preview for Android TV home screen (if you enabled it) (`settings - extended - android tv`)
- Disable integration with android mediasession and notification (`settings - extended - system`)
- Contact your provider

## EPG setup
You can check whatever EPG is provided and alive from your IPTV provider by navigating to `Settings - EPG - Reload`, and watching the status of reload process (looking for the number of sources processed, each sources processing result).  

If your provider has an EPG source but for some reason does not specify it in playlist, then it’s recommended to configure it in `Settings - Provider - (your provider) - Parameters - EPG`.
This way the channels mapping will be searched by both channel names and tvg-id fields.
If you configure EPG source in `Settings - EPG - User-provided` then matching by name is only used.

## Want easier way to input characters on my Android TV device (from Phone)
Some of the control apps recommended to serve as a secondary output to your TV/box:
- (Android) [Android TV Remote Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tv.remote)
- (iOS) [Android TV](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/android-tv/id1078761166)

# General issues

## Part of the screen is being cut by my TV (fighting against overscan)
Some TVs are coming with overscan enabled in their configuration (especially for HDMI ports). Possible solutions (better to worse sorted):
- Disable overscan on your TV
- Configure HDMI port on your TV to be of type PC (this also disables overscan)
- Open display settings on your device, and setup it to match your screen (usually named position and size)
- In OTT Nav app go to `settings - visual style - margins`, and set up a margin that matches your TV output.

## Want to stream video from phone to my TV, how to do it?
App supports 2 ways of sending a stream to a TV (when both are located in the same WiFi network). Both are not very reliable and cannot be used if your provider requires some DRM tags or specific attributes being passed in addition to the stream url. The options are:
- If your TV supports working as WiFi TV (and is acting as UPnP device), while playing video open the menu -> parameters -> send to TV -> select your device. If successful (and the stream supported by your TV) it will start playing on TV and you should stop playing it on your phone not to take extra network connection. Note, that TVs supports only limited set of stream types and might not support the one your provider is offering.
- If you are using an old Chromecast device (2020 and older) and have Chromecast devices available in the network there will be a button on HUD to send the stream. This does not apply to newer Chromecast that are actually a Google TV device with Android, so you can just install the app and use it via remote, instead of just casting the stream.

## Having multiple providers, how to manage channels?
The app has many options on how to manage channels from multiple providers.  
One the best that suits most use cases (when you need max channels from all providers and do not want to mess on them is):
- Remove/Hide categories you are not interested in
- Group channels (move) them so all channels of the same category (like sports) from all providers are located in the same category
- Enable duplicates folding. This way all channels with same or close names (like HD variants will be folded into a single record)
If a playback issue will occur the app will automatically switch to the next source (eg folded channel). You can alternatively manually switch between sources.
Note, that unless you manually switch the source of the exact channel, the default channel to be used will be the first one in the list if duplicate folding is disabled.  

Note, that the app sorts providers alphabetically and applies a list of channels from these providers in the order, providers are. So if you have sorting mode by provider being set, naming a provider alphabetically before others will cause their channels be higher in the list.  

Also quite popular is the quick provider switch option that adds a button on the main screen to enable/disable filters by a single/multiple provider you are currently interested in.  

Other, less popular, but still valuable options are to disable category merging between different providers, so “Sports” from provider A will not be merged with “Sports” from provider B, creating different categories instead. Also you can enable showing provider name in the channel name (either as a prefix or as a suffix of a channel)

## My list of channels messed up when I added a new provider
Providers are sorted and applied alphabetically. So if you had a provider named `BBB` in the app and made modifications to the groups, channels, etc, and then added a provider named `AAA` then some of the modifications will apply to the new provider `AAA`, since the provider list (as being sorted alphabetically) is now `AAA`, `BBB`.  
To preserve your metadata, ensure that new providers are AFTER the current ones. For example, you can add a prefix to the provider name like `1 BBB`, and `2 AAA` so alphabetically they will be `1 BBB`, `2 AAA` and channels/categories from the second provider will not be used for modifications made for the first one.

## Time is shown incorrectly on EPG, how to fix that?
Almost always when you see incorrect time it’s incorrect device setting (selected incorrect timezone), so go to the device settings and setup the time and time zone that correctly matches your region.  

If this does not help, here are some options available to you to make a virtual time shift:
- `Settings - Extended - System - Time shift (visual)`
- `Settings - Extended - System - Time shift (system)`
- (if the issue applies only to the some channels) open problematic `channel properties - EPG - time shift`
- (if using portal) open `provider properties - time shift`
  
After any of these changes you need to do manual EPG reload (`settings - epg - reload`) in order to apply the changes.

## How to protect some content from other users (parental control)
There are multiple ways to achive this
- Child mode (`settings - extended - child mode`) allows to specify which exact channels are available and hides all the other contect (PIN-protected)
- Restricted mode (`settings - extended - restrict`) allows you to setup a PIN code and protect settings, provider info, or categories/channels, etc to be available

## Want to use Studio mode (up to 9 videos at the same time) or Picture-in-Picture, but cannot find how to enable them
Studio and PiP mode requires you either having multiple providers, or having a provider that allows more than a single connection at the same time. App tries to detect number of connections via provider API, but sometimes might not be able to detect it correctly. To set a number of connections your provider allows manually:
- `Settings - Provider - (..your provider..) - Properties - Connections`
  
After changing, your will have studio mode option available on the main screen, as well as PiP menu option available from a playback menu screen if these modules are not been disabled. To enable if you previously disabled:
- Long tap any `icon on home screen - Modules` and ensure that Studio and PiP modules are enabled
- While in playback, `long tap any player menu icon` to check if the corresponding menu item has been enabled.

# Playback

## Buffering way too much
There might be multiple reasons for buffering - starting from poor Internet connection to some firmware specifics. Here comes a list of actions that usually helps if the cause is hardware/firmware, rather than the network issues:
- Set buffer size to minimal (`settings - player - network - buffer`)
- Change hardware codecs quality to compatibility (`settings - player - codec - hardware quality`)
- Disable AmLogic fix (`settings - player - codec - amlogic`)
- Change device resolution from 4K to Full HD on your device if not watching 4K usually

If the solutions above did not resolve your issue, then it's definitely a connectivity issue to your IPTV provider. You should contact him to fix the issue. You can also try setting buffer size to maximum.

## Problems with video/audio playback
Since the streams of your provider can be different, your hardware used for playback has different capabilities and your device firmware has bugs, there is no best configuration. App comes with hardware decoders, software decoders, and support for external player, defaulting to software codecs in most cases as being less dependent on firmware bugs.  

Please try using these settings in the suggested order and test which works best for you:
- Hardware codecs (compatibility mode) - most channels should work, especially if casted via HLS/DASH technology
- Hardware codecs (best match mode) - can help supporting original 4k satellite streams
- Software codecs (should support almost anything, but will work slower)
- External player

App remembers which codec was previously selected for channel and will reuse it in the future (unless disable this in settings)

## Horizontal scrolling text is unreadable
When app is using hardware codecs it has no control whatever deinterlacing will happen or not - it’s fully dependant on your device firmware. In order to insist on deinterlacing you should switch the channel to use software codecs that uses one of 3 different deinterlacing algorithms depending on what software codecs quality is selected.

## Audio track selection / Subtitles enabling
Sometimes hardware codecs are unable to detect different audio tracks availability (especially in some incorrect HLS streams) and may not support subtitles. In this scenario you can use player menu to switch to software codecs, so you will be able to select a different audio and subtitles track.

## Trying PiP / Studio Mode, but app says that connections limit reached
App tries to detect the number of connections your provider allows to protect you against ban by your provider. Some providers do not allow the detector to work so app defaults to a single connection in that case. You can override auto-detected connections limit yourself.  
Go to `Settings - Provider - (select your provider) - Parameters - Number of connections`.
Bear in mind, that you still can use multiple screens (PiP / Studio) using 1-connection providers, if you have a couple of them, since each provider is counted separately.

## Hostname … not verified / Chain validation failed / SSL error when trying to playback
This error means that your provider is using invalid SSL certificates (either self-signed or without a trusted root). Your solution might be:
- Ask provider to either fix the SSL issues or to provide a link to plain http-only configuration
- Disable certificate validation within the app:
  - `Settings -> difficulty -> expert`
  - `Settings -> extended -> system -> ignore invalid SSL`
  - Restart the app

## The app does not see all audio tracks
This usually means that your provider incorrectly encodes the stream (quite common when the provider is using HLS but actually sending all tracks in the same file while they should be split to different ones).  

Best option would be to ask the provider to give instructions how to setup one of the following:
- get a link that either runs mpeg-ts directly
- or ask for multi-hls setup

When it’s not possible, you can also try one of the following:
- Use system video codec (it might support multiple tracks when hardware codecs fails to find any)
- Use software VLC codecs (it uses more processing power but should in theory support almost any stream, just like external VLC player does)

## Playing DRM content and it’s not playing
In order to play DRM-protected contents you need to pass the correct DRM keys and extra data in the playlist. Check the M3U playlist structure on clues how to setup it.  
Please note, that DRM playback is only supported using hardware codecs - so using software VLC, system or external player has no way to pass these license data.

# Premium
## How many devices does Premium allow
Premium will be active on all your devices that, as long, as they:
- Have Google services working (with Play Store)
- Using the same Google account

For non-Google devices, please check FAQ.  
PS: Sometimes Play Store takes a while to sync purchases. Check FAQ how to speed up the process.  
PPS: Fair use policy is insisted, using same Google Account and using it on tons of devices are a clear violation.

## Enable premium on a Firestick (or other device without play market)
Recommended solution:
- Use Android device with Play Market to purchase premium as a single payment. Yearly subscription is also ok (monthly is not).
- Find notification email from Google with purchase number (`GPA.123.456..`), that will be required later on
- Forward this email or send this number to us; If you failed to find the purchase number, you can send your email name (google account used by you when purchased premium).
- On the device with Fire Stick attached launch the app
- Go to the `settings - about - installation id`; and send this number to us (either paste from clipboard, or scan QR code)
So we will activate the premium on this device  
WARNING: This number will drop if you uninstall app or remove app data  
PS: If you already purchased a subscription, you should refund it (or send us the purchase number GPA.123.456… so we will refund it) and buy app via one-time payment in order to be able to bind your purchase to the installation id on the non-play market device.  
PS: Since the activation is manual, it may take up to a few days to proceed.

## Purchased a premium but it’s not active
Sometimes it takes a while for Play Store to sync purchases (due to long caching). Steps to guarantee that sync will happen instantly:
- Go to `settings - premium - restore purchases`. If the process will report that restoration occurred - it means that all is ok, and reactivation has happened. Usually this is the only step required!
- Clear data and cache of Play Store app
- Clear cache of OTT Navigator app (usually not required)
- Reboot your device (might not be needed, but usually triggers cache update for Play Market), and relogin to Play Store
- Relaunch OTT Navigator
- (if does not help) Reinstall the app
  - Backup the configuration (settings - extended - backup - backup)
  - Write down the backup code
  - Delete the app
  - Install the app, restore the backup
  - Launch the app
- In case it does not help - contact our support (specifying google account used for purchase, or purchase number GPA…)

## Unable to process purchase (Error DF-PDP-3)
Recently Play Market stopped processing purchases when the app was not installed from it. Install application from play market and payment should work.

## Premium and multiple accounts on a single device
Play Market: When the device has several Google accounts, then it might switch between accounts by Google services itself, meaning that in-app purchases / subscriptions might be taken from one or other account with almost no user control. Best way to reactivate all purchases to correct account:
- Uninstall the app (backup is suggested via settings - extended - backup)
- Open browser on your desktop PC
- Open play market page [in your browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=studio.scillarium.ottnavigator)
- Log in to the web interface of Google Play with the account you used to purchase
- Install the app from the browser selecting the device to push the app to

## Will the premium purchase work for Family Library?
No, family library only apply to paid apps. Free apps with in-app purchases are not eligible for this. You can still use the app on several devices that share the same account.

## Currently subscribed to premium, willing to purchase via single payment forever
The app protects users from purchasing premium while he has active subscriptions (since it might lead to a person having both subscription and purchase), so you should cancel your subscription (it will continue working for the rest of subscribed period). And after some time an option to buy the app using a single payment will become available.

# Partnership / Reseller
## Branded app with customizations
If interested in whitelabel package (custom logo, background, providers, etc), then contact us via email `ottnav.partners@gmail.com` or reach us on Telegram (contact `@FlavusV`)

## Preparing devices for other users and wish to hide provider details
You can configure the app and then hide provider details.
- Go to the `settings - extended`, and long press the status line.
- You will be asked for a service code (if set) or receive access to service panel, that allows you changing the service code and/or disable provider settings details availability.

  - clearkey (ClearKey)
  - com.microsoft.playready (PlayReady)
- `inputstream.adaptive.license_key` (License key or URL depending on the DRM type; URLs should start from `http://` or `https://`, otherwise it’s a non-url key) and is considered being static
- `inputstream.adaptive.stream_headers` (extra headers, if required. For example `param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3`) (`v1.6.4.1+`)

http://example.com/channel/01
#EXTINF:-1 group-title="Sports", Sports News
http://example.com/channel/02
```

----

## Media library file (json)
App supports multiple formats for media library, but preferred format is json:

### Inner structure of the item ("info" field of movie/series/season/episodes)
- on no data - can be not added
- rating - 0-10, might be decimal like 5.6
- added - date when added (unix timestamp)
- ttl - available till (unix timestamp) if will be removed at this time
Sample:
```
"info": {
    "poster": "http://poster/image.jpg",
    "bg": "http://background/image.jpg",
    "plot": "Something happens...",
    "cast": [ "John Dow" , "Jane Dow" ],
    "director": [ "Mr. Smith" ],
    "country": [ "Zimbabve" ],
    "rating": "5.5",
    "year": 2019,
    "genre": [ "drama", "history" ],
    "added": 12354235,
    "duration": 3600,
    "adult": true,
    "ttl": 12354235
}
```

### Outer structure of the json file
- if no data, do not add a field; "info" is also not obligated field anywhere
- category - not mandatory field (if specified, the item will be placed in the folder).. might be either a "MyCat" or a json like `{"name":"MyCat","icon":"http:/..jpg"}`
- field "video" means it's a movie, "season" means it's series
- for episode "duration" in seconds
- "name" is episode name (if applicable)
- episodes and season numbers are not mandatory if they are listed incrementally (1, 2, 3, ..)
Sample:
```
[
{
    "name": "Test video",
    "category": "Action",
    "info": { ... },
    "video": "http://video/file.mp4",
},
{
    "name": "Test serial",
    "category": "Drama",
    "info": { ... },
    "seasons": [
        {
            "season": 1,
            "info": { ... },
            "episodes": [
                {
                    "episode": 1,
                    "name": "Intro",
                    "info": { ... },
                    "video": "http://episodes/file.mp4"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
]
```

So resulting file would be something like:
`[ {item1}, {item2}, {item3}, {item4} ]`

where items are described in previous section, and can include also an info field described in the first section
